    ðŸ¤– Personal Twitter bot powered by GPT technology ðŸ¦„
</p>

## ðŸš€ Concept

A funny Twitter bot that generates descriptions of a person every day. The bot uses the [GPT-4 model](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) to generate the descriptions with [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) to post on Twitter.

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment

You can deploy the bot on many platforms like [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), etc.

You need to create a cron job to run the script every day (or whenever you want). A cron job is like a task scheduler that runs a script at a specific time, or at a specific interval.

In Mac OS, you can use the `crontab` command to create a cron job. In Linux, you can use the `cron` command. In Windows, you can use the `Task Scheduler` to create a cron job.
